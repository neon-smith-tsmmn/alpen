//! # strata-chain-worker
//!
//! The `strata-chain-worker` crate provides a dedicated asynchronous worker
//! for managing Strata’s chainstate database. It encapsulates the logic for
//! fetching, executing, and finalizing L2 blocks and epochs, while handling
//! errors, workload dispatch, and state access in a concurrent environment.
